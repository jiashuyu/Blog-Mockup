1. I learned basic HTML grammar such as how to create divisions, paragraphs with bold and emphasis of 
our choices, buttons, headers with varies sizes, unordered lists, hyperlinks, images, and figures. I 
also learned basic structure of an html file. 

2. I found that using known HTML grammar to write an html file is pretty simple.

3. When there is some HTML element that I have never used before, searching for that element online can 
be pretty challenging. For example, when I want a horizontal line in the file and I searched online for 
that solution <hr></hr>, it took me quite a lot of time. Similar experience for <sup></sup> when I try 
to create footnotes in my file.

4. I try to refresh my html file in a browser from time to time to check if my html code is working 
properly.
